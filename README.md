Dynamic Surge Prediction: Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Ride-Sharing📌 Project OverviewThis project builds a predictive engine designed to forecast ride-sharing Surge Multipliers (via Demand Excess Ratios) for specific geographic zones in New York City. By analyzing 70M+ rows of taxi trip data, the model predicts supply-demand imbalances 15 minutes into the future.The goal is to transition from reactive surge pricing to proactive demand management, allowing platforms to signal drivers and adjust pricing before the imbalance occurs.🏗️ Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.xBig Data Engine: Dask (for out-of-core parallel processing of 70M+ records)Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPyMachine Learning: XGBoost / LightGBMAPIs: Open-Meteo (Historical Weather), NYC TLC (Trip Records)Environment: Virtual Environments (.venv), Jupyter/Neovim🛠️ Data Pipeline & Architecture1. Data IngestionRaw trip data is ingested from NYC TLC Parquet files. Due to the massive volume (70M+ rows), we utilize Dask to perform lazy loading and parallel aggregation, preventing memory (RAM) overflow.2. Spatio-Temporal BinningThe city is divided into TLC Taxi Zones, and time is discretized into 15-minute intervals.Demand: Count of pickups per [Zone, Time] bin.Supply: Count of dropoffs per [Zone, Time] bin (proxy for driver availability).3. Feature EngineeringThe model utilizes three categories of features:Core Spatio-Temporal: Supply Elasticity and Demand Velocity.Lagged Features: Historical demand and surge values from $t-15$ and $t-30$ minutes to capture autocorrelation.Exogenous Shocks: Real-time weather data (precipitation, temperature) and scheduled event data (stadium start/end times).📉 Modeling ApproachTarget Variable ($y$)The Demand Excess Ratio (DER) at $t+15$ minutes.$$y = \frac{\text{Active Requests}_{t+15}}{\text{Available Drivers}_{t+15}}$$Validation Strategy: Walk-Forward ValidationStandard random splits are avoided to prevent Data Leakage. We implement a strict Time-Series Split:Training: January – OctoberTesting: November (Unseen "future" data)
